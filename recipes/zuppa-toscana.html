        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Awaken the Fires</h3>
                <p>In a large 5.5-qt pot or Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, cook the chopped bacon until it turns crisp and golden (5–7 min).</p>
                <p>Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate, and carefully spoon out excess fat, leaving about 1 Tbsp behind to flavor the cauldron.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Summon the Sausage</h3>
                <p>Add the Italian sausage, breaking it apart with your spatula as it sears.</p>
                <p>Cook until browned through (about 5 min), then transfer to the plate of resting bacon warriors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Stir the Aromatics of Midgard</h3>
                <p>Add the finely diced onion to the pot, sauté until soft and golden (about 5 min).</p>
                <p>Stir in minced garlic and cook 1 min until fragrant as a northern wind.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Call the Broth to Boil</h3>
                <p>Pour in 6 cups broth and 4 cups water, then bring to a rolling boil.</p>
                <p>Add the sliced potatoes and cook 13–14 min, until they yield easily to a fork.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Unite the Warriors</h3>
                <p>When the potatoes are nearly tender, stir in the chopped kale and cooked sausage, returning the pot to a gentle boil to meld the flavors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cream of the Gods</h3>
                <p>Pour in 1 cup cream, stirring as the soup returns to a soft boil.</p>
                <p>Season to taste with salt and black pepper, then remove from the heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Bestow the Final Blessings</h3>
