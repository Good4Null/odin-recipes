            <ul>
                <li>1 vine tomato, chopped</li>
                <li>handful white onions, chopped</li>
                <li>handful shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dill pickle chips</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Stoke the Fires of Asgard</h3>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C), as if lighting the forges of the gods.</p>
            <p>Wash and chop your potatoes into small, bite-sized pieces (skins on if you wish for rustic glory). Smaller pieces will crisp faster in battle.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Sear the Potatoes of Midgard</h3>
            <p>Heat a sturdy pan over medium flame with a drizzle of golden olive oil.</p>
            <p>Add the potatoes and ¼ cup water, seasoning generously with salt and pepper.</p>
            <p>Stir often to prevent scorching until they soften like weary warriors (about 5–10 minutes, depending on size).</p>
            <p>Transfer these potato stones to your baking dish.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Combine the Feast of Warriors</h3>
            <p>In the same pan, add ground beef and onions.</p>
            <p>Cook until the beef is mostly conquered by flame and the onions are soft.
            </p>

            <p>Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and mustard, stirring well to unite the flavors.</p>
            <p>Add this savory legion to the potatoes and mix them together.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Crown your Casserole</h3>
            <p>Shower the mixture with shredded cheddar, the golden treasure of the mortal realms.</p>
            <p>Cover with foil like a shining shield and bake for 15 minutes, until the cheese melts into molten glory.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Conjure the Sauce of Asgard</h3>
            <p>While it bakes, craft your sacred sauce: combine mayo, ketchup, chopped pickles, and a splash of pickle brine, stirring until smooth.</p>
            <p>Chill this divine elixir in the fridge until it’s time to anoint your creation.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Finish the Casserole</h3>
            <p>Remove the foil shield and drizzle the Asgard Sauce in generous streaks — leave none behind, for the gods are generous.</p>
            <p>Crown your feast with shredded lettuce, chopped white onion, diced tomato, and full pickle chips.</p>
            <p>Behold: your Asgard Big Mac Supreme, worthy of the halls of Valhalla.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
