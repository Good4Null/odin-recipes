            <p>These golden zucchini fritters have been a beloved staple in our hall for many summers — crisp-edged on the outside, soft at heart, and quick to make.</p>
            <p>Served warm with cool sour cream, they’re tiny green shields of flavor, perfect for feeding your clan from the garden’s bounty.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lb zucchini, about 2 large or 5 medium</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt, divided</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped green onions</li>
                <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
                <li>olive oil for sautéing</li>
                <li>sour cream, to serve</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Prepare the Garden's Bounty</h3>
                    <p>Wash your zucchini harvest and trim off their ends.</p>
                    <p>Grate them using the large holes of a box grater (or a food processor grater if you prefer swifter magic).</p>
                    <p>Place the shredded zucchini in a large mixing bowl, stir in 1 tsp salt, and let them rest for 10 minutes—allowing the moisture to surrender before the battle begins.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Drain the Waters of Midgard</h3>
                    <p>After their 10-minute rest, take the salted zucchini and squeeze them mightily over the sink to drive out the hidden waters.
                    (If you wield a cheesecloth, wring them out like a seasoned warrior—far more liquid will fall than you expect!)
                    </p>
                    <p>You should be left with 3½ to 4 cups of dry, battle-ready zucchini.</p>
                    <p>Return them to a large mixing bowl, prepared for the next stage of your fritter quest.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Summon the Binders of the Realm</h3>
                    <p>To your battle-ready zucchini, add ½ cup chopped green onion for a spark of garden brightness,
                    then stir in 2 lightly beaten eggs — the golden binders that will unite your fritter forces as one.
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Forge the Fritter Batter</h3>
                    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together ¾ cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp black pepper (or to taste) — your dry runes of power.</p>
                    <p>Fold this flour mixture into the zucchini blend, stirring until united in a smooth, battle-ready batter.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Sear the Shields of Summer</h3>
                    <p>Set a heavy-bottomed cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat, and pour in 2 Tbsp olive oil, letting it shimmer like the forges of the gods.</p>
                    <p>Scoop the zucchini mixture into the pan, a heaping tablespoon at a time, gently flattening each into a tiny battle shield.Sear 3–5 minutes per side until golden brown and crisp at the edges.
                    </p>
                    <p>If they brown too quickly, lower the flame to avoid scorching your warriors.Serve these shields of summer warm, crowned with a dollop of cool sour cream.
                    </p>
